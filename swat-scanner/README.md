redirect_check - Open redirect vulnerability checks

full_audit - Comprehensive web application audit

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples
Example 1: Full Website Audit
bash
swat> use full_audit
swat(full_audit)> set TARGET example.com
swat(full_audit)> run

## Example 2: SQL Injection Testing
swat> use sqli_detector
swat(sqli_detector)> set TARGET testphp.vulnweb.com
swat(sqli_detector)> run
Example 3: Subdomain Discovery
bash

## üé™ Exploitation Demos
After scanning, SWAT can generate interactive HTML demonstrations:

## XSS Demo
Creates an HTML file with working XSS popups

Shows how payloads execute in victim browsers

Includes educational explanations

## SQL Injection Demo
Generates data extraction reports

Shows stolen credentials and database information

Demonstrates real attack impact

## Redirect Attack Demo
Simulates open redirect vulnerabilities

Shows phishing attack scenarios

Includes live redirect demonstrations
