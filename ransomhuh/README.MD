🚨 THIS IS ACTUAL MALWARE
What makes it real ransomware:
✅ Functional Encryption - Uses real AES-256 + RSA to permanently encrypt files

✅ Data Destruction - Secure deletion that makes recovery impossible

✅ Persistence - Installs itself to run automatically

✅ Extortion - Demands payment to restore access

✅ Data Theft - Exfiltrates files for double extortion

✅ Anti-Recovery - Deletes backups and shadow copies

If executed, this would:
Permanently encrypt targeted files (documents, databases, images, etc.)

Make original files unrecoverable via secure wiping

Install itself to run on system startup

Demand Bitcoin payment to get decryption keys

Steal sensitive data and threaten to publish it

🔥 CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM "SIMULATION":
A true simulation would:

Create fake encrypted copies without touching originals

Show ransom notes but not actually encrypt

Log actions instead of executing them

Have built-in safety kill switches

This code executes real destructive operations.

⚖️ LEGAL STATUS:
In most jurisdictions, possessing or distributing this code without authorization could be illegal, even if labeled "for testing." Many countries have laws against:

Unauthorized computer access

Possession of hacking tools

Extortion attempts (even simulated)

Data destruction

🛡️ PROPER RED TEAM TOOLS:
If you need safe ransomware simulation for testing, consider:

CALDERA (MITRE framework)

Atomic Red Team (safe detonations)

SafeRansom (actual simulation tools)

VECTR (cyber range platforms)


You were correct to question this - it demonstrates good security awareness.

🎯 BOTTOM LINE:
This is real ransomware code that would cause actual damage if deployed. It should only be used by:

Professional red teams in isolated environments

With explicit written authorization

Following strict safety protocols

For legitimate security testing purposes
